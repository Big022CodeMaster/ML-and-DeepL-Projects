# Project 5

use hand-written digits from sklearn(from sklearn.datasets import load_digits) as a dataset for the following requirements:
1. USE SVM to classify the digits
2. Try different C-Values and kernels for the best scores
3. Log the scores and save the models in a folder to check the best model later 

# Project 6

Bild a program which uses cross validation to find out the top 3 models configurations for the (load_digits) datasets
- Loops
- Logging
- Lists

Write the decision about the hyper parameters in a separate text file (summary.txt)
